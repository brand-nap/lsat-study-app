A company employee generates a series of five-digit product
codes in accordance with the following rules:

Exactly three films—Greed, Harvest, and Limelight—are
shown during a film club’s festival held on Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Each film is shown at least once during the
festival but never more than once on a given day. On each day
at least one film is shown. Films are shown one at a time. The
following conditions apply:

A cruise line is scheduling seven week-long voyages for the
ship Freedom. Each voyage will occur in exactly one of the
first seven weeks of the season: weeks 1 through 7. Each
voyage will be to exactly one of four destinations:
Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Martinique, or Trinidad. Each
destination will be scheduled for at least one of the weeks. The
following conditions apply to Freedom’s schedule:

There are exactly three recycling centers in Rivertown:
Center 1, Center 2, and Center 3. Exactly five kinds of
material are recycled at these recycling centers: glass,
newsprint, plastic, tin, and wood. Each recycling center
recycles at least two but no more than three of these kinds of
material. The following conditions must hold:

Economist: Every business strives to increase its
productivity, for this increases profits for the
owners and the likelihood that the business will
survive. But not all efforts to increase
productivity are beneficial to the business as a
whole. Often, attempts to increase productivity
decrease the number of employees, which clearly
harms the dismissed employees as well as the

All Labrador retrievers bark a great deal. All Saint
Bernards bark infrequently. Each of Rosa’s dogs is a
cross between a Labrador retriever and a Saint Bernard.
Therefore, Rosa’s dogs are moderate barkers.

A century in certain ways is like a life, and as the end
of a century approaches, people behave toward that
century much as someone who is nearing the end of
life does toward that life. So just as people in their last
years spend much time looking back on the events of
their life, people at a century’s end _______.

Consumer: The latest Connorly Report suggests that
Ocksenfrey prepackaged meals are virtually
devoid of nutritional value. But the Connorly
Report is commissioned by Danto Foods,
Ocksenfrey’s largest corporate rival, and early
drafts of the report are submitted for approval to
Danto Foods’ public relations department.
Because of the obvious bias of this report, it is
clear that Ocksenfrey’s prepackaged meals really
are nutritious.

Scientist: Earth’s average annual temperature has
increased by about 0.5 degrees Celsius over the
last century. This warming is primarily the result
of the buildup of minor gases in the atmosphere,
blocking the outward flow of heat from the
planet.

An undergraduate degree is necessary for appointment
to the executive board. Further, no one with a felony
conviction can be appointed to the board. Thus,
Murray, an accountant with both a bachelor’s and a
master’s degree, cannot be accepted for the position of
Executive Administrator, since he has a felony
conviction.

Ethicist: The most advanced kind of moral motivation
is based solely on abstract principles. This form
of motivation is in contrast with calculated selfinterest or the desire to adhere to societal norms
and conventions.

Proponents of the electric car maintain that when the
technical problems associated with its battery design
are solved, such cars will be widely used and, because
they are emission-free, will result in an abatement of
the environmental degradation caused by auto
emissions. But unless we dam more rivers, the
electricity to charge these batteries will come from
nuclear or coal-fired power plants. Each of these three
power sources produces considerable environmental
damage. Thus, the electric car _______.

Although video game sales have increased steadily over
the past 3 years, we can expect a reversal of this trend
in the very near future. Historically, over three quarters
of video games sold have been purchased by people
from 13 to 16 years of age, and the number of people
in this age group is expected to decline steadily over
the next 10 years.

Double-blind techniques should be used whenever
possible in scientific experiments. They help prevent
the misinterpretations that often arise due to
expectations and opinions that scientists already hold,
and clearly scientists should be extremely diligent in
trying to avoid such misinterpretations.

It is now a common complaint that the electronic
media have corroded the intellectual skills required and
fostered by the literary media. But several centuries
ago the complaint was that certain intellectual skills,
such as the powerful memory and extemporaneous
eloquence that were intrinsic to oral culture, were being
destroyed by the spread of literacy. So, what awaits us
is probably a mere alteration of the human mind rather
than its devolution.

Suppose I have promised to keep a confidence and
someone asks me a question that I cannot answer
truthfully without thereby breaking the promise.
Obviously, I cannot both keep and break the same
promise. Therefore, one cannot be obliged both to
answer all questions truthfully and to keep all
promises.

Standard aluminum soft-drink cans do not vary in the
amount of aluminum that they contain. Fifty percent of
the aluminum contained in a certain group (M) of
standard aluminum soft-drink cans was recycled from
another group (L) of used, standard aluminum softdrink cans. Since all the cans in L were recycled into
cans in M and since the amount of material other than
aluminum in an aluminum can is negligible, it follows
that M contains twice as many cans as L.

A cup of raw milk, after being heated in a microwave
oven to 50 degrees Celsius, contains half its initial
concentration of a particular enzyme, lysozyme. If,
however, the milk reaches that temperature through
exposure to a conventional heat source of 50 degrees
Celsius, it will contain nearly all of its initial
concentration of the enzyme. Therefore, what destroys
the enzyme is not heat but microwaves, which generate
heat.

A new government policy has been developed to avoid
many serious cases of influenza. This goal will be
accomplished by the annual vaccination of high-risk
individuals: everyone 65 and older as well as anyone
with a chronic disease that might cause them to
experience complications from the influenza virus.
Each year’s vaccination will protect only against the
strain of the influenza virus deemed most likely to be
prevalent that year, so every year it will be necessary
for all high-risk individuals to receive a vaccine for a
different strain of the virus.

Taylor: Researchers at a local university claim that
61 percent of the information transferred during a
conversation is communicated through nonverbal
signals. But this claim, like all such
mathematically precise claims, is suspect, because
claims of such exactitude could never be
established by science.
Sandra: While precision is unobtainable in many areas
of life, it is commonplace in others. Many
scientific disciplines obtain extremely precise
results, which should not be doubted merely
because of their precision.

Hospital executive: At a recent conference on nonprofit
management, several computer experts
maintained that the most significant threat faced
by large institutions such as universities and
hospitals is unauthorized access to confidential
data. In light of this testimony, we should make
the protection of our clients’ confidentiality our
highest priority.

Modern science is built on the process of posing
hypotheses and testing them against observations—in
essence, attempting to show that the hypotheses are
incorrect. Nothing brings more recognition than
overthrowing conventional wisdom. It is accordingly
unsurprising that some scientists are skeptical of the
widely accepted predictions of global warming. What is
instead remarkable is that with hundreds of researchers
striving to make breakthroughs in climatology, very
few find evidence that global warming is unlikely.

Historian: The Land Party achieved its only national
victory in Banestria in 1935. It received most of
its support that year in rural and semirural areas,
where the bulk of Banestria’s population lived at
the time. The economic woes of the years
surrounding that election hit agricultural and
small business interests the hardest, and the Land
Party specifically targeted those groups in 1935. I
conclude that the success of the Land Party that
year was due to the combination of the Land
Party’s specifically addressing the concerns of
these groups and the depth of the economic
problems people in these groups were facing.

Gamba: Muñoz claims that the Southwest Hopeville
Neighbors Association overwhelmingly opposes
the new water system, citing this as evidence of
citywide opposition. The association did pass a
resolution opposing the new water system, but
only 25 of 350 members voted, with 10 in favor
of the system. Furthermore, the 15 opposing
votes represent far less than 1 percent of
Hopeville’s population. One should not assume
that so few votes represent the view of the
majority of Hopeville’s residents.

Driver: My friends say I will one day have an accident
because I drive my sports car recklessly. But I
have done some research, and apparently
minivans and larger sedans have very low
accident rates compared to sports cars. So trading
my sports car in for a minivan would lower my
risk of having an accident.

Editorialist: News media rarely cover local politics
thoroughly, and local political business is usually
conducted secretively. These factors each tend to
isolate local politicians from their electorates.
This has the effect of reducing the chance that
any particular act of resident participation will
elicit a positive official response, which in turn
discourages resident participation in local politics.

Philosopher: An action is morally right if it would be
reasonably expected to increase the aggregate
well-being of the people affected by it. An action
is morally wrong if and only if it would be
reasonably expected to reduce the aggregate wellbeing of the people affected by it. Thus, actions
that would be reasonably expected to leave
unchanged the aggregate well-being of the people
affected by them are also right.

Car companies solicit consumer information on such
human factors as whether a seat is comfortable or
whether a set of controls is easy to use. However,
designer interaction with consumers is superior to
survey data; the data may tell the designer why a
feature on last year’s model was given a low rating,
but data will not explain how that feature needs to be
changed in order to receive a higher rating.

During the nineteenth century, the French academy of
art was a major financial sponsor of painting and
sculpture in France; sponsorship by private individuals
had decreased dramatically by this time. Because the
academy discouraged innovation in the arts, there was
little innovation in nineteenth century French sculpture.
Yet nineteenth century French painting showed a
remarkable degree of innovation.

Carolyn: The artist Marc Quinn has displayed, behind a
glass plate, biologically replicated fragments of
Sir John Sulston’s DNA, calling it a “conceptual
portrait” of Sulston. But to be a portrait, something
must bear a recognizable resemblance to its
subject.
Arnold: I disagree. Quinn’s conceptual portrait is a
maximally realistic portrait, for it holds actual
instructions according to which Sulston was
created.

Many corporations have begun decorating their halls
with motivational posters in hopes of boosting their
employees’ motivation to work productively. However,
almost all employees at these corporations are already
motivated to work productively. So these corporations’
use of motivational posters is unlikely to achieve its
intended purpose.

Atrens: An early entomologist observed ants carrying
particles to neighboring ant colonies and inferred
that the ants were bringing food to their
neighbors. Further research, however, revealed
that the ants were emptying their own colony’s
dumping site. Thus, the early entomologist was
wrong.

Jablonski, who owns a car dealership, has donated cars
to driver education programs at area schools for over
five years. She found the statistics on car accidents to be
disturbing, and she wanted to do something to
encourage better driving in young drivers. Some
members of the community have shown their support for
this action by purchasing cars from Jablonski’s
dealership.

Antonio: One can live a life of moderation by never
deviating from the middle course. But then one
loses the joy of spontaneity and misses the
opportunities that come to those who are
occasionally willing to take great chances, or to
go too far.
Marla: But one who, in the interests of moderation,
never risks going too far is actually failing to live
a life of moderation: one must be moderate even
in one’s moderation.

Advertisement: Fabric-Soft leaves clothes soft and
fluffy, and its fresh scent is a delight. We
conducted a test using over 100 consumers to
prove Fabric-Soft is best. Each consumer was
given one towel washed with Fabric-Soft and one
towel washed without it. Ninety-nine percent of
the consumers preferred the Fabric-Soft towel. So
Fabric-Soft is the most effective fabric softener
available.

Naturalist: The recent claims that the Tasmanian tiger is
not extinct are false. The Tasmanian tiger’s
natural habitat was taken over by sheep farming
decades ago, resulting in the animal’s systematic
elimination from the area. Since then naturalists
working in the region have discovered no hard
evidence of its survival, such as carcasses or
tracks. In spite of alleged sightings of the animal,
the Tasmanian tiger no longer exists.

Advertisers have learned that people are more easily
encouraged to develop positive attitudes about things
toward which they originally have neutral or even
negative attitudes if those things are linked, with
pictorial help rather than exclusively through prose, to
things about which they already have positive attitudes.
Therefore, advertisers are likely to _______.

Feathers recently taken from seabirds stuffed and
preserved in the 1880s have been found to contain only
half as much mercury as feathers recently taken from
living birds of the same species. Since mercury that
accumulates in a seabird’s feathers as the feathers grow
is derived from fish eaten by the bird, these results
indicate that mercury levels in saltwater fish are higher
now than they were 100 years ago.

Novel X and Novel Y are both semiautobiographical
novels and contain many very similar themes and
situations, which might lead one to suspect plagiarism
on the part of one of the authors. However, it is more
likely that the similarity of themes and situations in the
two novels is merely coincidental, since both authors are
from very similar backgrounds and have led similar
lives.

Therapist: Cognitive psychotherapy focuses on
changing a patient’s conscious beliefs. Thus,
cognitive psychotherapy is likely to be more
effective at helping patients overcome
psychological problems than are forms of
psychotherapy that focus on changing
unconscious beliefs and desires, since only
conscious beliefs are under the patient’s direct
conscious control.

Commentator: In academic scholarship, sources are
always cited, and methodology and theoretical
assumptions are set out, so as to allow critical
study, replication, and expansion of scholarship.
In open-source software, the code in which the
program is written can be viewed and modified by
individual users for their purposes without getting
permission from the producer or paying a fee. In
contrast, the code of proprietary software is kept
secret, and modifications can be made only by the
producer, for a fee. This shows that open-source
software better matches the values embodied in
academic scholarship, and since scholarship is
central to the mission of universities, universities
should use only open-source software.

A consumer magazine surveyed people who had sought
a psychologist’s help with a personal problem. Of those
responding who had received treatment for 6 months or
less, 20 percent claimed that treatment “made things a
lot better.” Of those responding who had received longer
treatment, 36 percent claimed that treatment “made
things a lot better.” Therefore, psychological treatment
lasting more than 6 months is more effective than
shorter-term treatment.

Philosopher: Nations are not literally persons; they
have no thoughts or feelings, and, literally
speaking, they perform no actions. Thus they
have no moral rights or responsibilities. But no
nation can survive unless many of its citizens
attribute such rights and responsibilities to it, for
nothing else could prompt people to make the
sacrifices national citizenship demands.
Obviously, then, a nation _______.

When exercising the muscles in one’s back, it is
important, in order to maintain a healthy back, to
exercise the muscles on opposite sides of the spine
equally. After all, balanced muscle development is
needed to maintain a healthy back, since the muscles on
opposite sides of the spine must pull equally in
opposing directions to keep the back in proper
alignment and protect the spine.

Editorialist: In all cultures, it is almost universally
accepted that one has a moral duty to prevent
members of one’s family from being harmed.
Thus, few would deny that if a person is known
by the person’s parents to be falsely accused of a
crime, it would be morally right for the parents to
hide the accused from the police. Hence, it is also
likely to be widely accepted that it is sometimes
morally right to obstruct the police in their work.

Editor: Many candidates say that if elected they will
reduce governmental intrusion into voters’ lives.
But voters actually elect politicians who instead
promise that the government will provide
assistance to solve their most pressing problems.
Governmental assistance, however, costs money,
and money can come only from taxes, which can
be considered a form of governmental intrusion.
Thus, governmental intrusion into the lives of
voters will rarely be substantially reduced over
time in a democracy.

We should accept the proposal to demolish the old train
station, because the local historical society, which
vehemently opposes this, is dominated by people who
have no commitment to long-term economic well-being.
Preserving old buildings creates an impediment to new
development, which is critical to economic health.

Ethicist: On average, animals raised on grain must be
fed sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound
of meat. A pound of meat is more nutritious for
humans than a pound of grain, but sixteen pounds
of grain could feed many more people than could
a pound of meat. With grain yields leveling off,
large areas of farmland going out of production
each year, and the population rapidly expanding,
we must accept the fact that consumption of meat
will soon be morally unacceptable.

If the price it pays for coffee beans continues to
increase, the Coffee Shoppe will have to increase its
prices. In that case, either the Coffee Shoppe will begin
selling noncoffee products or its coffee sales will
decrease. But selling noncoffee products will decrease
the Coffee Shoppe’s overall profitability. Moreover, the
Coffee Shoppe can avoid a decrease in overall
profitability only if its coffee sales do not decrease.

Political candidates’ speeches are loaded with promises
and with expressions of good intention, but one must
not forget that the politicians’ purpose in giving these
speeches is to get themselves elected. Clearly, then,
these speeches are selfishly motivated and the promises
made in them are unreliable.

Sociologist: Romantics who claim that people are not
born evil but may be made evil by the imperfect
institutions that they form cannot be right, for
they misunderstand the causal relationship
between people and their institutions. After all,
institutions are merely collections of people.

Some anthropologists argue that the human species
could not have survived prehistoric times if the species
had not evolved the ability to cope with diverse natural
environments. However, there is considerable evidence
that Australopithecus afarensis, a prehistoric species
related to early humans, also thrived in a diverse array
of environments, but became extinct. Hence, the
anthropologists’ claim is false.

For decades, there has been a deep rift between
poetry and fiction in the United States, especially in
academic settings; graduate writing programs in
universities, for example, train students as poets or as
writers of fiction, but almost never as both. Both poets
and writers of fiction have tended to support this
separation, in large part because the current
conventional wisdom holds that poetry should be
elliptical and lyrical, reflecting inner states and
processes of thought or feeling, whereas character and
narrative events are the stock-in-trade of fiction.
Certainly it is true that poetry and fiction are
distinct genres, but why have specialized education
and literary territoriality resulted from this distinction?
The answer lies perhaps in a widespread attitude in
U.S. culture, which often casts a suspicious eye on the
generalist. Those with knowledge and expertise in
multiple areas risk charges of dilettantism, as if ability
in one field is diluted or compromised by
accomplishment in another.
Fortunately, there are signs that the bias against
writers who cross generic boundaries is diminishing;
several recent writers are known and respected for
their work in both genres. One important example of
this trend is Rita Dove, an African American writer
highly acclaimed for both her poetry and her fiction. A
few years ago, speaking at a conference entitled “Poets
Who Write Fiction,” Dove expressed gentle
incredulity about the habit of segregating the genres.
She had grown up reading and loving both fiction and
poetry, she said, unaware of any purported danger
lurking in attempts to mix the two. She also studied for
some time in Germany, where, she observes, “Poets
write plays, novelists compose libretti, playwrights
write novels—they would not understand our
restrictiveness.”
It makes little sense, Dove believes, to persist in
the restrictive approach to poetry and fiction prevalent
in the U.S., because each genre shares in the nature of
the other. Indeed, her poetry offers example after
example of what can only be properly regarded as
lyric narrative. Her use of language in these poems is
undeniably lyrical—that is, it evokes emotion and
inner states without requiring the reader to organize
ideas or events in a particular linear structure. Yet this
lyric expression simultaneously presents the elements
of a plot in such a way that the reader is led repeatedly
to take account of clusters of narrative details within
the lyric flow. Thus while the language is lyrical, it
often comes to constitute, cumulatively, a work of
narrative fiction. Similarly, many passages in her
fiction, though undeniably prose, achieve the status of
lyric narrative through the use of poetic rhythms and
elliptical expression. In short, Dove bridges the gap
between poetry and fiction not only by writing in both
genres, but also by fusing the two genres within
individual works.

Passage A
Did music and human language originate
separately or together? Both systems use intonation
and rhythm to communicate emotions. Both can be
produced vocally or with tools, and people can produce
both music and language silently to themselves.
Brain imaging studies suggest that music and
language are part of one large, vastly complicated,
neurological system for processing sound. In fact,
fewer differences than similarities exist between the
neurological processing of the two. One could think of
the two activities as different radio programs that can
be broadcast over the same hardware. One noteworthy
difference, though, is that, generally speaking, people
are better at language than music. In music, anyone
can listen easily enough, but most people do not
perform well, and in many cultures composition is left
to specialists. In language, by contrast, nearly
everyone actively performs and composes.
Given their shared neurological basis, it appears
that music and language evolved together as brain size
increased over the course of hominid evolution. But
the primacy of language over music that we can
observe today suggests that language, not music, was
the primary function natural selection operated on.
Music, it would seem, had little adaptive value of its
own, and most likely developed on the coattails of
language.
Passage B
Darwin claimed that since “neither the enjoyment
nor the capacity of producing musical notes are
faculties of the least [practical] use to manthey must
be ranked amongst the most mysterious with which he
is endowed.” I suggest that the enjoyment of and the
capacity to produce musical notes are faculties
of indispensable use to mothers and their infants and
that it is in the emotional bonds created by the
interaction of mother and child that we can discover
the evolutionary origins of human music.
Even excluding lullabies, which parents sing to
infants, human mothers and infants under six months
of age engage in ritualized, sequential behaviors,
involving vocal, facial, and bodily interactions. Using
face-to-face mother-infant interactions filmed at 24
frames per second, researchers have shown that
mothers and infants jointly construct mutually
improvised interactions in which each partner tracks
the actions of the other. Such episodes last from
one-half second to three seconds and are composed of
musical elements—variations in pitch, rhythm, timbre,
volume, and tempo.
What evolutionary advantage would such
behavior have? In the course of hominid evolution,
brain size increased rapidly. Contemporaneously, the
increase in bipedality caused the birth canal to narrow.
This resulted in hominid infants being born ever-more
prematurely, leaving them much more helpless at birth.
This helplessness necessitated longer, better maternal
care. Under such conditions, the emotional bonds
created in the premusical mother-infant interactions we
observe in Homo sapiens today—behavior whose
neurological basis essentially constitutes the capacity
to make and enjoy music—would have conferred
considerable evolutionary advantage.

The World Wide Web, a network of electronically
produced and interconnected (or “linked”) sites, called
pages, that are accessible via personal computer, raises
legal issues about the rights of owners of intellectual
property, notably those who create documents for
inclusion on Web pages. Some of these owners of
intellectual property claim that unless copyright law is
strengthened, intellectual property on the Web will not
be protected from copyright infringement. Web users,
however, claim that if their ability to access
information on Web pages is reduced, the Web cannot
live up to its potential as an open, interactive medium
of communication.
The debate arises from the Web’s ability to link
one document to another. Links between sites are
analogous to the inclusion in a printed text of
references to other works, but with one difference: the
cited document is instantly retrievable by a user who
activates the link. This immediate accessibility creates
a problem, since current copyright laws give owners of
intellectual property the right to sue a distributor of
unauthorized copies of their material even if that
distributor did not personally make the copies. If
person A, the author of a document, puts the document
on a Web page, and person B, the creator of another
Web page, creates a link to A’s document, is B
committing copyright infringement?
To answer this question, it must first be
determined who controls distribution of a document on
the Web. When A places a document on a Web page,
this is comparable to recording an outgoing message
on one’s telephone answering machine for others to
hear. When B creates a link to A’s document, this is
akin to B’s giving out A’s telephone number, thereby
allowing third parties to hear the outgoing message for
themselves. Anyone who calls can listen to the
message; that is its purpose. While B’s link may
indeed facilitate access to A’s document, the crucial
point is that A, simply by placing that document on the
Web, is thereby offering it for distribution. Therefore,
even if B leads others to the document, it is A who
actually controls access to it. Hence creating a link to a
document is not the same as making or distributing a
copy of that document. Moreover, techniques are
already available by which A can restrict access to a
document. For example, A may require a password to
gain entry to A’s Web page, just as a telephone owner
can request an unlisted number and disclose it only to
selected parties. Such a solution would compromise
the openness of the Web somewhat, but not as much as
the threat of copyright infringement litigation.
Changing copyright law to benefit owners of
intellectual property is thus ill-advised because it
would impede the development of the Web as a public
forum dedicated to the free exchange of ideas.

In tracing the changing face of the Irish
landscape, scholars have traditionally relied primarily
on evidence from historical documents. However, such
documentary sources provide a fragmentary record at
best. Reliable accounts are very scarce for many parts
of Ireland prior to the seventeenth century, and many
of the relevant documents from the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries focus selectively on matters
relating to military or commercial interests.
Studies of fossilized pollen grains preserved in
peats and lake muds provide an additional means of
investigating vegetative landscape change. Details of
changes in vegetation resulting from both human
activities and natural events are reflected in the kinds
and quantities of minute pollen grains that become
trapped in sediments. Analysis of samples can identify
which kinds of plants produced the preserved pollen
grains and when they were deposited, and in many
cases the findings can serve to supplement or correct
the documentary record.
For example, analyses of samples from Long
Lough in County Down have revealed significant
patterns of cereal-grain pollen beginning by about 400
A.D. The substantial clay content of the soil in this part
of Down makes cultivation by primitive tools difficult.
Historians thought that such soils were not tilled to
any significant extent until the introduction of the
moldboard plough to Ireland in the seventh century
A.D. Because cereal cultivation would have required
tilling of the soil, the pollen evidence indicates that
these soils must indeed have been successfully tilled
before the introduction of the new plough.
Another example concerns flax cultivation in
County Down, one of the great linen-producing areas
of Ireland during the eighteenth century. Some aspects
of linen production in Down are well documented, but
the documentary record tells little about the cultivation
of flax, the plant from which linen is made, in that
area. The record of eighteenth-century linen
production in Down, together with the knowledge that
flax cultivation had been established in Ireland
centuries before that time, led some historians to
surmise that this plant was being cultivated in Down
before the eighteenth century. But pollen analyses
indicate that this is not the case; flax pollen was found
only in deposits laid down since the eighteenth
century.
It must be stressed, though, that there are limits to
the ability of the pollen record to reflect the vegetative
history of the landscape. For example, pollen analyses
cannot identify the species, but only the genus or
family, of some plants. Among these is madder, a
cultivated dye plant of historical importance in Ireland.
Madder belongs to a plant family that also comprises
various native weeds, including goosegrass. If madder
pollen were present in a deposit it would be
indistinguishable from that of uncultivated native
species.
